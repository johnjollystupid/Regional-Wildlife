# Regional-Wildlife
This is a mod for The Long Dark by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc. 

It allows the user to choose which wildlife spawns in each region. The main motivation for this was watching Alaskan survival shows and realising that people had to travel to different regions to find specific game. So if you want only timberwolves in Timberwolf Mountain, deer in Mystery Lake & bears in Pleasant Valley - you can.
